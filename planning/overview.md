## 1. Core Systems (software utilities)
- Math library (for matrix multiplications, vectors)
- Physics library
- Audio library
- 3D rendering libray
- Standard Template Library (STL) 

## 2. Resources (game assets, 3D rendering library)
- 3D objects
- Textures
- Materials
- Fonts

## 3. Low-level renderer (3D rendering library)
- Draw submitted geometry (meshes, lines, points)
- Shaders (vertex, fragment)
- Lighting
- Camera (FOV, near, far)

## 4. Scene graph
- Limit primitives submitted for rendering (discard the ones that are not visible)

## 5. Front end
- 2D menu interfaces

## 6. Collision and physics
- Collision detection for the 3D objects in the game
- Motion of the controllable character

## 7. Animation
- Animation of the 3D objects in the game

## 8. Human interface devices (HID)
- Keyboard and mouse input

## 9. Audio
- Suitable background music

## 10. Gameplay foundations
- Event system 

## 11. Game specific subsystems
- Limited world
- One controllable character
	- Walk around
	- Interact with objects
- A number of quests to finish
	- Find objects, solve puzzles, earn reward (3D objects)
- Placement of objects in the world
